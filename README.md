## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the form including fields for full name, email, password, and age.
2. **CSS**: Provides basic styling to make the form user-friendly and visually appealing.
3. **JavaScript**: Handles real-time validation of each input field, preventing form submission if any of the fields contain invalid data. The `onsubmit` event is intercepted by the `validateForm()` function to prevent default form submission and to ensure all fields are valid.
